  <body> HERE"S WHERE THE PROJECT STARTS
    <p><h3>The Unspoken Intensity of Inside</h3></p>
    <p><font color="green">Inside is a narrative horror game that tells a story of a young 
boy’s journey to unlock the secrets of an oppressive world. It's an immensely powerful 
experience that draws players in with its immersive atmosphere and captivating visuals. 
One moment in particular stands out as especially memorable: when the protagonist first 
comes across a group of hostile guards. The tension created by the music, the 
monochromatic visuals, and the menacing guards combined to create a sense of dread 
that left me feeling uneasy. The guards stood in stark contrast to the isolated and peaceful 
nature of the protagonist’s journey, providing a stark reminder of the dangers that 
awaited him if he continued. It was a powerful moment that made me realize the gravity of 
the situation and gave me a better understanding of the stakes involved.  Despite the 
danger, I felt compelled to continue, eager to uncover the mysteries that lay hidden in this 
oppressive world.  All of these elements combined to craft an unforgettable experience.      
<p>The designers of Inside are clearly influenced by German Expressionism and heavily reference it
  as you can see in Example 1:</p>
  <p>Example 1: <IMG SRC="https://cdn.nivoli.com/adventuregamers/images/screenshots/36555/20170211224955_1.jpg"></p>
    <p>This image reminds me of <i>https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.c6896347104f4709b2795324d52642dc?rik=uWGai4TqyrkYVw&riu=http%3a%2f%2f3.bp.blogspot.com%2f-s21tOkA6DKQ%2fTqVmBzZCQUI%2fAAAAAAAAAHA%2fIhJhvyo4WAI%2fs1600%2fbg_german_expressionism_by_fikey-d38mld5.jpg&ehk=r2Gp%2bRX43eaBgUIA9%2fZAbI1e2zglETw%2bYCaF17r574o%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0&sres=1&sresct=1</i>. 
Comparing these two images, the black and white contrast is what especially stands out to me, as the spotlights create a more dramatic scene. The lights in the artwork act as the spotlight camera does in the screenshot from Inside, and add to the tension felt by both the main character we play as and from ourselves as we control the character’s actions.
