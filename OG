  <body> HERE"S WHERE THE PROJECT STARTS

    <p><h3>Limbo and Art History: The Role of German Expressionism in the Game's Design</h3></p>

    <p><font color="green"> This purpose of this project is to explore both the manifest and latent
      traces of German Expressionism in Limbo from the Danish Group Playdead. I assume no previous
      knowledge of either gaming or programming. The project will, however, explore some dimensions of music and sound
      in connection with my approach to the game. I recommend playing the game before reading and listening to
      this project as that will enhance your experience. Thank You!</font></p>

    <p>The designers of Limbo clearly were influenced by German Expressionsism
  as you can see in Example 1:</p>

  <p>Example 1: <IMG SRC="http://www.davidbardschwarz.com/images/germ.png"></p>

    <p>This image reminds me of <i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</i>. The film is black and white; it employs
    severe spatial perspective warps, and the entire ambience is both "inside" and "outside."</p>

HERE IS WHERE THE SKETCH OF MY PROJECT STOPS; BELOW IS THE PONG GAME
